## Overview

GraphK provides the core execution model for graph-based programming. It defines 
pipelines as executable graphs composed of nodes, branches, and nested pipelines, 
with explicit control flow and runtime semantics. GraphK is UI-agnostic and 
domain-independent, serving as the foundation on which all other GraphK modules 
and products are built.
